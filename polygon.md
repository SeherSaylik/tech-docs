**POLYGON**

Supports two major types of Ethereum-compatible networks:
1.	Stand-alone networks


*These networks are fully sovereign and responsible from only its own pool.

*They can have their own consensus models such as PoS or DPos.

*Side chains(Ethereum-compatible, independent blockchains which employ their own consensus models and block parameters to efficiently process transactions.)

2.	Secured chains


*Service can be provided either by Ethereum directly or by a pool of professional validators like Polkadot's.

*Layer 2

**What is Matic?**

Matic Network is a Layer 2 scaling solution that achieves scale by utilizing sidechains for off-chain computation while ensuring asset security using the Plasma framework and a decentralized network of Proof-of-Stake (PoS) validators.

**How it works?**

Matic validators combining or batching the transactions and then sending them to the Ethereum chain. Let's say a matic validator consolidated 30 transactions and sent them to the Ethereum network. In this case, the gas price will be divided into 30. 
In Matic we have only one sidechain like Ethereum. On the side chain is given by a PoS consensus. Their block producers are producing blocks and validators are validating and then creating a check points and they put them to the ETH blockchain.
